# Airline_Delay_Analysis

## Introduction:
We're examining the problem of flight delays in our Tableau data visualization project. Airline
companies, airports, and passengers are all impacted by these delays. They lead to dissatisfied
consumers and increased expenditure. To address this, we're utilizing a dataset from the United States Bureau of Transportation Statistics. It provides thorough information on why planes are delayed in the United States.
The dataset covers various reasons for delays, like airline-specific issues, bad weather, system
constraints, security matters, and late-arriving planes. Our objective is to evaluate the data and identify trends. We want to assist airlines and airports to make sound decisions based on facts. We can develop methods to mitigate the impact of delays by identifying the root causes. Finally, we want to improve the overall flying experience for everyone.

## Analysis:
The dashboards reveals significant differences in flight delay performance across U.S. airlines. Among all, Southwest Airlines stands out with the highest average carrier delay, totalling 3,161 over the year, while Allegiant Air (G4) shows the lowest at 411. This also suggests variations in operational efficiency, fleet management, and other factors between carriers. Arrival diversions, when flights are redirected to airports other than their planned destinations, also vary widely. In January 2023, SkyWest Airlines (OO) had the most with 162 diversions, while Hawaiian Airlines (HA) had only 9. These rankings indicate operational difficulties or external factors affecting airline performance. Analyzing flight cancellations shows that Southwest, American (AA), and Envoy Air (MQ) lead the pack, with Southwest averaging around 20 cancellations per period, the highest among all carriers. This points to potential challenges in scheduling, maintenance, or other operational aspects for these airlines. Airport operations significantly impact flight delays. Atlanta Airport (ATL) experiences the highest arrival delays, suggesting bottlenecks that need to be addressed. Seasonal patterns also emerge, with winter months like December, January, and February seeing the most weather-related delays, particularly at Denver Airport (DEN). Denver (DEN) specifically saw the highest number of weather delays in January 2023, totalling 31,875. Correlating arrival delays with total arriving flight volume provides insights into airport efficiency. This analysis can help identifying airports that manage high traffic well and those that need to enhance operations to minimize delays, ultimately improving the passenger experience. In summary, the data highlights substantial differences in delay performance across U.S. airlines and airports, driven by a range of operational, environmental, and infrastructure factors. This analysis can inform strategic decisions to enhance efficiency and mitigate the impact of flight disruptions.

## Business Implications: 

### For AirLines

#### High Cancellation Rates:
 Airlines with the highest cancellation rates like WN, AA, and MQ need to address potential scheduling, maintenance, or operational issues to improve their reliability and customer satisfaction. 
#### Arrival Diversions: 
Frequent diversions indicate operational hurdles or external factors impacting efficiency. Airlines experiencing high diversion rates should analyze the causes and implement solutions to minimize them. 

### For Airports

#### Flight Delays:
Airlines with high average delays like WN need to investigate the contributing factors like fleet management or operational inefficiencies and implement strategies for improvement. 
#### Arrival Delays:
Airports with the highest delays like Atlanta (ATL) should analyze bottlenecks and implement targeted solutions to enhance operational efficiency and passenger experience. 
#### Seasonal Trends:
Understanding the monthly trends in delays allows airports to anticipate challenges, allocate resources effectively, and implement preventative measures during peak delay periods. 
#### Weather Delays:
Airports experiencing high weather delays like DEN in winter months might need to invest in infrastructure improvements or winter preparedness measures. 

### Overall Industry: 

#### Passenger Experience: 
Frequent cancellations, diversions, and delays negatively impact passenger experience, potentially leading to lost business and damaged reputation for airlines and airports. 
#### Operational Costs:
Delays and cancellations incur additional costs for airlines, including crew compensation, re-accommodation expenses, and potential fuel waste. 
#### Resource Allocation:
 Understanding the root causes of these issues allows airlines, airports, and aviation authorities to allocate resources strategically and implement targeted solutions for improvement.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our analysis of the flight delay data has provided valuable insights into the causes, patterns, and trends of disruptions in the airline industry. Through visualizing and exploring the data on delays caused by factors such as weather, carrier cancellations, and arrival delays, we have identified actionable items for airlines to improve their operations and minimize the impact of disruptions on their customers. These include improving weather preparedness during the winter months, allocating resources based on seasonal patterns, analyzing and benchmarking against industry peers, and improving scheduling and maintenance practices to reduce delays. By implementing these measures, airlines can provide better service to their customers and maintain a competitive edge in a challenging industry.
